Kasal turns complex AI orchestration into an intuitive visual experience. Design, deploy, and monitor autonomous AI agents that collaborate to solve real-world business problems — without writing orchestration code.

## Why Kasal?

- **Visual Workflow Designer** — Drag-and-drop canvas for composing sophisticated agent interactions
- **Enterprise-Ready** — Built for Databricks with OAuth, teamspace isolation, and scale in mind
- **Extensible Toolkit** — A rich library of tools, including Genie, MCP servers, custom APIs, and data connectors
- **Real-Time Monitoring** — Live execution tracking with detailed logs, traces, and performance insights
- **Production-Grade** — Robust error handling, retry logic, and enterprise deployment patterns

## What You Can Build

- **Data Analysis Pipelines** — Agents that query, analyze, and visualize your data
- **Content Generation Systems** — Collaborative agents for research, writing, and content creation
- **Business Process Automation** — Intelligent workflows that adapt and make decisions
- **Customer Support Assistants** — Multi-agent systems with specialized knowledge domains
- **Research & Development** — Agents that gather, synthesize, and present insights

## Get Started in Minutes

### Databricks Marketplace (Recommended)
Install directly from the Databricks Apps Marketplace with one click — the best path for production, with automatic updates and enterprise support.

### Deploy from Source
Use the deployment script in this repository for custom installations. Ideal for tailored configurations and advanced setups.

### Local Development
A quick setup for testing and development — requires Python 3.11 (pinned `>=3.11,<3.12`), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Node.js 22.

## See It in Action

*The visual workflow designer for building AI agent collaborations*

Create your first agent workflow in under two minutes:

1. **Design** — Drag agents onto the canvas and define their roles
2. **Connect** — Link agents together to form collaboration flows
3. **Execute** — Hit run and watch your agents work as a team
4. **Monitor** — Follow real-time logs and execution traces

## Architecture

Kasal follows a clean, layered architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

**Frontend (React)** → **API (FastAPI)** → **Services** → **Repositories** → **Database**

The CrewAI engine plugs in at the service layer to drive intelligent agent orchestration.

## Known Limitations

### Entity Memory with Specific Models
Entity extraction in memory backends has known compatibility issues with:
- **Databricks Claude** (`databricks-claude-*`) — JSON schema validation errors
- **Databricks GPT-OSS** (`databricks-gpt-oss-*`) — empty response errors

**Automatic fallback:** When these models are detected, Kasal transparently uses `databricks-llama-4-maverick` for entity extraction while keeping your chosen model for every other agent task.
