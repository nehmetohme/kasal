"""Live-app adapter for the shared A2UI composer.

The composer itself (``src.shared.a2ui.compose``) is portable and stdlib-only —
it takes an injected ``llm_call``. This thin adapter is the Kasal-side wiring:
it builds ``llm_call`` from Kasal's ``LLMManager`` (which already injects the
Kasal User-Agent telemetry header) and runs the blocking composer off the event
loop via ``asyncio.to_thread``. The exported app has its own equivalent wiring in
``agent_server/agent.py`` — same composer, different ``llm_call``.

Used post-answer by the execution runners (light + crew paths) to turn an
agent's text answer into a renderable A2UI surface. Never raises; returns a
surface dict, or ``None`` when A2UI is disabled or there is no text to render.
