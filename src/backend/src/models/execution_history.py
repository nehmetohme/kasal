    """Database model for tracking AI agent execution history and state.

    This model represents a complete execution lifecycle of a CrewAI job or workflow,
    tracking status, results, errors, and supporting multi-tenant isolation through
    group-based data segregation.

    The model supports comprehensive execution tracking including:
    - Execution lifecycle management (pending, running, completed, failed)
    - Graceful stop functionality with partial results
    - Multi-tenant isolation via group IDs
    - Relationship tracking to tasks and error traces

    Attributes:
        id: Primary key identifier
        job_id: Unique execution identifier (UUID)
        status: Current execution status
        inputs: JSON input parameters for the execution
        result: JSON output/results from the execution
        error: Error message if execution failed
        planning: LEGACY historical flag. Kasal removed the CrewAI-style prose
            planner, so this is never populated from a request any more and stays
            at its False default; it is kept so pre-removal rows still read back.
        trigger_type: How execution was triggered (api, schedule, etc.)
        created_at: Timestamp when execution started
        completed_at: Timestamp when execution completed
        run_name: Human-readable name for the execution

        Stop Execution Fields:
        stopped_at: Timestamp when stop was requested
        stop_reason: Reason for stopping (user_requested, timeout, etc.)
        stop_requested_by: User who requested the stop
        partial_results: Results captured before stopping
        is_stopping: Flag indicating execution is being stopped

        group_id: Group identifier for data isolation
        group_email: User email for audit trail
