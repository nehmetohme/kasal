    CrewAI's default persistence writes flow state to a stray SQLite file outside
    Kasal's DB (lost on restart in ephemeral/prod and never in Lakebase). This table
    keeps that state inside Kasal's database instead — SQLite in dev, Lakebase/Postgres
    in prod — so checkpoints survive restarts and are queryable by the app.

    The table is append-only: each method completion writes a new row. The most recent
    row for a given ``flow_uuid`` is the current checkpoint used to resume.
