    ``DATABRICKS_APP`` is the only one that produces an export.

    ``PYTHON_PROJECT`` and ``DATABRICKS_NOTEBOOK`` are RETIRED but deliberately
    still members. Both generated projects that ran on ``pip install crewai``, a
    second agent engine to keep in agreement with Kasal's by hand, and their
    exporters are gone.

    Dropping the members outright was the first attempt, and it was the wrong
    failure: pydantic rejects the request before it reaches any of our code, so
    a caller that had been exporting notebooks for months gets a bare 422
    ``Input should be 'databricks_app'`` with no hint that the format was
    removed, when, or what to do instead. Keeping them lets
    ``CrewExportService`` answer with a 410 that says all three.

    The cost of keeping them: a genuinely unknown format now gets a 422 reading
    "Input should be 'databricks_app', 'python_project' or 'databricks_notebook'",
    which offers two formats that do not work. Accepted knowingly — picking one
    of them yields the 410 that explains, so the caller is one informative step
    from the answer either way, and that beats a first step that explains
    nothing.

    See ``RETIRED_EXPORT_FORMATS`` for the messages.
