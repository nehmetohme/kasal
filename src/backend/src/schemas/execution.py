        execution_id: Unique identifier of the execution being queried.
        status: Current execution status (pending, running, completed, failed,
            stopping, stopped). Reflects the overall execution state.
        is_stopping: Flag indicating if a stop operation is currently in progress.
            True during graceful shutdown, False otherwise.
        stopped_at: Timestamp when the execution was stopped. None if execution
            completed normally or is still running.
        stop_reason: Human-readable reason provided when stop was requested.
            Useful for audit trails and debugging stopped executions.
        progress: Dictionary containing detailed progress information such as
            completed tasks, current task, completion percentage, etc.

    Example:
        >>> # Running execution
        >>> response = ExecutionStatusResponse(
        ...     execution_id="exec_123",
        ...     status="running",
        ...     is_stopping=False,
        ...     progress={
        ...         "total_tasks": 5,
        ...         "completed_tasks": 2,
        ...         "current_task": "data_analysis",
        ...         "percentage": 40
        ...     }
        ... )

        >>> # Stopped execution
        >>> stopped_response = ExecutionStatusResponse(
        ...     execution_id="exec_456",
        ...     status="stopped",
        ...     is_stopping=False,
        ...     stopped_at=datetime.utcnow(),
        ...     stop_reason="User requested cancellation",
        ...     progress={"completed_tasks": 3, "total_tasks": 7}
        ... )

    Note:
        The progress field structure may vary based on execution type
        (crew vs flow) and implementation details.
