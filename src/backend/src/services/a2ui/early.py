"""The instant shell: a surface frame on screen before the answer exists.

For the deliverables that OWN a canvas (quiz, flashcards, mindmap, map), the
request alone tells us a surface of that shape is coming — so a frame with a
derived title ships immediately, no model call, and the composed surface
replaces it when it lands. Best-effort and never raises: if it fails,
composition proceeds exactly as before and the reader simply waits.

(The deck shell and the outline pre-plan that used to live here are gone —
presentations are no longer an A2UI deliverable; they render on the chat
HTML path.)
