"""The light agent's transcript of THIS chat session.

Each light-agent turn is an isolated kickoff with no built-in history; this
module builds the "conversation so far" block that is prepended to the kickoff
prompt so the agent can recall what was said (the user's name, an earlier
instruction, the answer on screen). :func:`build_conversation_preamble` owns the
scoring — which turns survive a long, bloated session and how far each is cut —
and the rationale lives on its docstring. ``context_compaction`` produces the
summary block it folds in for turns older than the fold marker.

Read-only and best-effort: any failure yields ``""`` and the turn still answers.

    """Recent turns of THIS chat session as a short transcript, weighted so
    the user's own statements survive a long/bloated conversation.

    Each light-agent turn is an isolated ``kickoff_async`` with no built-in
    conversation history, so without this the assistant cannot recall what was
    said earlier (e.g. the user's name). Read-only and best-effort: returns
    ``""`` on any issue. The current turn (the just-written user row + its
    ``Thinking...`` / ``[ui-card]`` placeholder rows) is excluded.

    Scoring (why this beats a flat "last N turns" window): a long chat is
    dominated by large ASSISTANT outputs (decks, reports) that would otherwise
    push the short, high-signal USER facts out of the window. So USER turns are
    prioritized — every user turn is kept (capped per-turn), and only the most
    recent assistant turns are kept and hard-truncated. Under the overall
    character budget the OLDEST assistant turns are dropped first; user turns
    are never dropped. The header also tells the model to treat the user's
    statements as authoritative.

    One exception to the truncation: the MOST RECENT answer. It is what the
    next turn refers to — "as a table", "shorter", the same question asked
    again — and a 240-char stub of it left the agent unable to restate a report
    it could not see, so it went and researched it again. That answer is kept
    whole under its own cap (``chat_history_last_answer_char_cap``, 12k chars,
    about 3k tokens) and sits outside the budget. Older answers stay stubs: a
    whole transcript of decks and reports would overflow the model window and
    slow every turn, and the compaction summary already carries what they said.
