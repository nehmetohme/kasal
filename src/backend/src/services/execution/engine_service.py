"""CrewAI Engine Service for AI agent orchestration.

This module provides the core engine service for CrewAI-based agent execution,
handling both individual crew executions and complex flow orchestrations.

The service integrates with the CrewAI framework to manage multi-agent systems,
coordinate task execution, and provide comprehensive tracing and monitoring
capabilities for AI workflows.

Key Features:
    - Crew preparation and configuration management
    - Flow orchestration for complex multi-crew workflows
    - Process-based execution isolation for reliability
    - Real-time trace capture and event monitoring
    - Tool factory integration for dynamic tool loading
    - Multi-tenant support with group context isolation

Architecture:
    The service extends BaseEngineService and acts as the primary interface
    between the application layer and the CrewAI framework. It manages the
    lifecycle of crew executions, from configuration through completion.

Example:
    >>> service = KasalEngineService()
    >>> await service.initialize(llm_provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
    >>> result = await service.run_execution(
    ...     execution_id="exec_123",
    ...     execution_config=crew_config,
    ...     group_context=group_ctx
    ... )

    This service provides comprehensive management of CrewAI-based agent systems,

    The service integrates with various subsystems including:

    - Process isolation for reliable execution
    - Event callbacks for real-time updates
