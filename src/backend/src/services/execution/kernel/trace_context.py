"""Execution trace-context attach shared by the crew and flow paths.

After a crew is built, its memory storages and tools are tagged with the
execution's job_id + group attribution so custom trace events (e.g. llm_call)
carry the right ownership. Both the crew path (``crew_preparation``) and the
flow path (``flow.modules.flow_methods``) attach this identically through the
single entry point here.
