"""Generic conversation layer for a deployed Kasal crew.

Every app Kasal deploys ships this same layer; only the injected crew specifics
(purpose, required input, LLM, crew runner) differ. It wraps the synthesized crew
in a conversational, info-gathering assistant — it chats with the user, explains
what the crew can do, gathers/clarifies the input the crew needs, and only runs
the crew once it has enough. Multi-turn history is kept per conversation id.

Each turn is a single deterministic pass: classify -> (gather|run) -> reply.
(Implemented with plain agent calls rather than a CrewAI Flow to avoid the Flow
event bus re-entering / looping inside the server.)
