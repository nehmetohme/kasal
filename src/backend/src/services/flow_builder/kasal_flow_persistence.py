"""Kasal-backed CrewAI flow-state persistence.

CrewAI's default ``@persist`` writes flow state to a stray SQLite file
(``~/Library/Application Support/.../flow_states.db``) that is NOT Kasal's database
and is lost on restart in ephemeral/production environments (Databricks Apps +
Lakebase). This implementation routes save/load through Kasal's own database so
checkpoints land in SQLite (dev) or Lakebase/Postgres (prod), survive restarts,
and are queryable by the app.

Bridging note: CrewAI's :class:`FlowPersistence` API is *synchronous* and its hooks
run inside the flow's already-running event loop, while Kasal's DB access is async
(and, for Lakebase, loop-/token-bound). We therefore run each async DB operation on
a short-lived dedicated thread + event loop. This avoids ``asyncio.run`` deadlocks
(we're already inside a running loop) and lets Kasal's swappable session factory
build a loop-correct, Lakebase-aware engine for that thread — the same mechanism
crew threads already rely on.
