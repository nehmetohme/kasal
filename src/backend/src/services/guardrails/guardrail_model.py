"""Shared resolver for the model an LLM guardrail should validate with.

An LLM guardrail judges a task's output, so it must use the SAME model the run
is using — the model the user selected in the chat input (Agent Builder or
ChatMode) or, more generally, the model the validated task's agent runs with.
That selection flows top-down: chat input -> execution ``config['model']`` ->
each agent's LLM. The guardrail therefore sources its model from the agent it
validates (falling back to the run-level config model), NOT from a per-task
``llm_model`` field that can drift from the run.

Centralizing this keeps one definition of "the guardrail's model" and one copy
of the provider-prefix handling, reused by every guardrail-build site (crew
tasks, flow tasks, and the code-based GuardrailFactory guardrails).
