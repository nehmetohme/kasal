"""
Trace Broadcast Service for real-time SSE updates.

This service runs in the main process and polls the database for new traces
written by subprocess executions, then broadcasts them via SSE to connected clients.

This bridges the gap between:
- Subprocess: Writes traces to database (can't broadcast SSE - no clients connected)
- Main process: Has SSE clients connected but doesn't know about new traces

The service:
1. Tracks the last broadcasted trace ID per job
2. Periodically polls for new traces for jobs with active SSE connections
3. Broadcasts new traces via the SSE manager
