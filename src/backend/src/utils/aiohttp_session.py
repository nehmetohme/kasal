"""
Shared aiohttp ClientSession pool, keyed by running event loop.

PERF-012/PERF-020: embedding and Vector Search call sites used to create a
fresh aiohttp.ClientSession (new TCP + TLS handshake, ~50-150ms against a
Databricks workspace) for every single HTTP call. aiohttp sessions are bound
to the event loop they were created on, so a plain module-level singleton
breaks under Kasal's multi-loop reality (FastAPI loop, crew subprocess loops,
sync-bridge thread loops). Instead we keep one session per *live* loop and
hand it out via a context manager that never closes it.

Usage (drop-in for ``async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:``):

    from src.utils.aiohttp_session import shared_client_session

    async with shared_client_session() as session:
        async with session.post(url, json=payload, timeout=timeout) as resp:
            ...

Pass per-request ``timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(...)`` to the request call —
session-level timeouts don't apply here because the session is shared.
