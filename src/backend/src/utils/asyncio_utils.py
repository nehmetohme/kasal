    instead** — this is that function's local-DB branch, not a general-purpose
    helper.

    It resolves its engine by importing ``nullpool_engine`` from ``db.session``
    directly: no ``is_lakebase_enabled()`` check, no router, no way to reach
    Lakebase however the app is configured. On a Lakebase deployment anything
    calling this reads and writes a database the app is no longer using — a miss
    that surfaces as "row not found" rather than an error, so it is invisible
    until someone asks why a value that was definitely saved cannot be read.
    That cost real debugging time: tool API keys resolved as "not configured"
    while the row sat in Lakebase, and the execution safety-net silently found no
    stuck rows to fix.

    Kept (rather than inlined into ``execute_db_operation_smart``) because the
    engine choice below is load-bearing for SQLite, per the note it carries:

    IMPORTANT: Reuses the global engine instead of creating fresh engines.
    This prevents:
    - WAL checkpoint interruption during engine disposal
    - Connection lifecycle conflicts with StaticPool
    - Silent data loss from incomplete checkpoints
    - "file is not a database" corruption errors

    Based on 2025 SQLite best practices research which showed that:
    - Creating and disposing StaticPool engines repeatedly violates its design
    - Engine disposal can interrupt WAL checkpoint operations
    - Multiple competing engines cause checkpoint conflicts
    - Proper pattern: Reuse long-lived global engine

    For SQLite: Uses the global StaticPool engine (single connection)
    For PostgreSQL: Uses dedicated NullPool engine for background tasks

    Args:
        operation: A callable that takes an AsyncSession and returns a coroutine

    Returns:
