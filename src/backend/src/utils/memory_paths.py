"""Deterministic on-disk location for LOCAL (DEFAULT) cognitive memory.

The DEFAULT backend is kasal's own SQLite store — ``memory.db`` under the group
directory, written by engines/kasal/memory/local_storage_backend.py (embeddings
as float32 blobs, search by numpy cosine). It is NOT LanceDB: that was crewAI's
built-in default and left with the crewai library. A leftover
``<group>/memory/memories.lance/`` directory from before the engine migration is
dead weight and safe to delete.

crewAI resolved a *relative* ``CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR`` inconsistently — sometimes
under the process CWD (the backend source tree), sometimes under the platform
data dir (macOS Application Support, Linux ``~/.local/share``). That scattered
the store across locations and left the memory browser reading a different place
than the runtime wrote.

We pin an **absolute** root *outside* the source tree so the writer and the
browser always agree, and so production (Linux) uses a known data folder.
Override the root with the ``KASAL_MEMORY_DIR`` environment variable.

Storage model mirrors ChatMode / Lakebase: ONE store per group
(``kasal_default_<group_id>``). Session scoping is NOT a separate directory — it
is encoded in each record's scope path (``/<group_id>/<session_id>/...``), so a
session record is visible both workspace-wide (group) and session-scoped.
