"""Multi-tenant user and group context management for authentication and isolation.

This module provides comprehensive utilities for managing user authentication
contexts and group-based multi-tenant data isolation in the AI agent system.
It handles access token extraction from HTTP headers, group membership management,
and context propagation throughout the execution pipeline.

The module supports hybrid isolation modes:
- Individual mode: Users without groups get private data spaces
- Group mode: Users in groups share data within their assigned groups

Key Features:
    - Access token extraction from HTTP headers (Databricks integration)
    - Automatic group assignment based on email domains
    - Hybrid individual/group isolation modes
    - Context variable management for request-scoped data
    - Group membership lookup and caching

Architecture:
    Uses Python's contextvars for thread-safe, async-compatible context
    management across the entire request lifecycle.

Example:
    >>> context = await GroupContext.from_email(
    ...     email="user@company.com",
    ...     access_token="token_123"
    ... )
    >>> UserContext.set_group_context(context)

# --- Group-membership resolution cache ---------------------------------------
# Resolving a user's group memberships costs several DB round-trips
# (users + group_users + groups) plus a commit, and it runs on EVERY
# authenticated request. Status/trace polling from the run-history UI fires
# this dozens of times per second for a single running job even though
# membership almost never changes mid-session — it was the dominant query
# load on the hot path. Cache the resolved (user, groups_with_roles) tuple per
# email for a short TTL so repeat polls do zero DB work. Membership mutations
# call clear_membership_cache() to drop stale entries immediately, and the TTL
# bounds staleness for anything that mutates outside this process.

    """Hybrid group context for multi-tenant data isolation and access control.

    This class manages group-based data isolation with support for both individual
    and collaborative access modes. It provides the foundation for multi-tenant
    data segregation throughout the application.

    Supports two isolation modes:
        1. Individual mode: Users not in any groups get their own private group
           for complete data isolation
        2. Group mode: Users in groups can access data from all their assigned
           groups, enabling team collaboration

    Attributes:
        group_ids: List of all group IDs the user belongs to
        group_email: User's email address for identification
        email_domain: Domain extracted from email for organization mapping
        user_id: Optional user identifier from authentication system
        access_token: Databricks or OAuth access token for API calls
        user_role: User's role in the primary group (admin, editor, operator)
        highest_role: User's highest role across ALL groups (for authorization)
        current_user: The User model instance with permission fields

    Properties:
        primary_group_id: Returns the first group ID for creating new data

    Example:
        >>> context = await GroupContext.from_email(
        ...     email="alice@acme-corp.com",

        >>> print(context.user_role)  # "editor"

    Note:
        The context is designed to be immutable once created and should be
        passed through the execution pipeline for consistent isolation.

class UserContext:
    """Thread-safe user context manager for authentication and authorization.
    
    This class provides static methods for managing user authentication context
    throughout the request lifecycle. It uses Python's contextvars to maintain
    thread-safe, async-compatible context that follows the request through all
    layers of the application.
    
    The context manager handles:
    - User access token storage and retrieval
    - User metadata and profile information
    - Group context for multi-tenant isolation
    - Request-scoped context propagation
    
    All methods are static as the class acts as a namespace for context
    operations, with the actual state stored in context variables.
    
    Example:
        >>> # Set context at request entry
        >>> UserContext.set_user_token("Bearer token_123")
        >>> UserContext.set_group_context(group_context)
        >>> 
        >>> # Retrieve context anywhere in the request
        >>> token = UserContext.get_user_token()
        >>> group = UserContext.get_group_context()
    
    Note:
        Context is automatically cleaned up at the end of each request/task
        by the async runtime.
