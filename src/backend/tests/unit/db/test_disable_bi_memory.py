"""Unit test for the bi-specialist crew-memory self-heal
(_disable_bi_specialist_crew_memory).

The BI pipeline crews used to run with memory enabled, which auto-saved the
~174K-char pipeline-config JSON to workspace memory and recalled it into every
later prompt → context-window overflow. Memory is now disabled for these crews,
but the seeder is insert-only so already-seeded DBs keep memory on. This startup
self-heal flips them off. Verifies it disables only the bi-specialist group, is
idempotent, and leaves other groups untouched.
