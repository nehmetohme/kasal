"""Unit test for the workspace→teamspace group-name data heal
(_heal_personal_group_names).

Auto-created personal groups persisted "Personal Workspace - <email>" in
groups.name before the tenant concept was renamed to "teamspace" (the personal
tenant is now the "Personal Space"). The heal rewrites those rows in place on
startup. Verifies the rename, idempotency,
that non-personal / Databricks-unrelated names are untouched, and that a
missing table doesn't raise.
