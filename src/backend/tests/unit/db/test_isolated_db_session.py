"""Regression tests for get_isolated_db_session (private-connection isolation).

Background — the bug these guard against:

Progressive crew generation commits an agent, then makes a seconds-long LLM call,
then inserts a task referencing that agent. On SQLite the whole app shares ONE
connection (StaticPool), and SQLite transactions are per-connection. During that
long window a concurrent request's session — sharing the same connection — could
commit/rollback and silently discard the just-written agent, after which the
task INSERT failed with "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" (tasks.agent_id ->
agents.id). The fix routes the generation flow onto its OWN connection
(get_isolated_db_session, a NullPool engine for SQLite) so no other session can
interfere.

These tests demonstrate the mechanism (shared connection loses the write) and
the property the fix relies on (a private connection does not).
