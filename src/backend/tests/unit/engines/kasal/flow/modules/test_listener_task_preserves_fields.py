"""Guard: the flow listener's runtime Task rebuild must preserve execution config.

flow_methods rebuilds each listener task at runtime to inject previous-step
context. The original code constructed `Task(description=, agent=, expected_output=)`
only — silently dropping tools, output_pydantic, output_json and converter_cls.
That made @listen crews lose their tools (no MCP/tool calls) and their structured
schema (no .pydantic → flaky routing). This guards against regressing to the
field-dropping reconstruction.

Asserted via source because the rebuild lives inside a runtime closure that needs
a fully-built flow to exercise.
