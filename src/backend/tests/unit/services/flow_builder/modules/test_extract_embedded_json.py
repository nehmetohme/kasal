"""Tests for extract_embedded_json — pulling router fields out of prose-wrapped JSON.

On the soft output_json path a crew often returns its structured answer inside a
```json ... ``` block surrounded by prose ("Based on my research… ```json {…} ```
## Summary …"). The router's direct-JSON check missed these, so has_results was
never read and the flow stopped without routing. This helper extracts the JSON.
