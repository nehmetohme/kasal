"""Tests for deploy.py — recursive remote prune.

Regression coverage for the deploy failure where the Databricks Apps source
sync overran the platform's hard 10-minute app-start window
(``App process did not start within 10 minutes``).

Root cause: ``prune_remote_dir`` was shallow (top-level only). Vite
content-hashes every frontend chunk (``index-<hash>.js``), so each build emits
NEW filenames and the old ones are orphaned. ``databricks sync`` only
adds/overwrites — it never mirror-deletes — so the orphans piled up inside
``frontend_static/assets`` across deploys (2400+ remote vs ~150 real) and got
re-synced into the app compute every time. The shallow prune skipped them
because ``assets/`` (a directory) still exists locally by name.

The fix makes the prune recurse into subdirectories that still exist locally,
so orphaned files *inside* them are deleted.
