"""Tests for deploy.py — slow-deployment timeout handling.

Regression coverage for the case where the Databricks SDK waiter
(``waiter.result()``) gives up after its 20-minute default while the deployment
is still downloading source / building server-side. The deploy should poll the
deployment status instead of reporting a false failure.
