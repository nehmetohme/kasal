"""
Direct deployment script for Kasal application.

Deploys backend source, prebuilt frontend assets, and docs to Databricks Apps.
The frontend is BUILT LOCALLY on every deploy (npm run build via the root
package.json lifecycle) and ships as static assets in frontend_static/.

Scopes: by default BOTH frontend and backend are uploaded. Pass --frontend to
upload only the frontend (and docs), or --backend to upload only the backend.
Upload uses `databricks sync` per component — full upload by default, pass
--diff for an incremental (changed-files-only) sync.
