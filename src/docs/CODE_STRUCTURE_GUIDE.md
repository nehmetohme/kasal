# Code structure

Use this map to find the owner of a change. Backend domain packages and the
frontend feature packages identify the owner of each view and its supporting code.

## Repository and build ownership

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/backend/` | Backend environment, dependency manifest, tests and migrations |
| `src/backend/src/` | FastAPI application; Python imports use the `src` package |
| `src/backend/scripts/maintenance/`, `scripts/diagnostics/` | Operator-run maintenance and diagnostic scripts; outside the shipped application |
| `src/frontend/` | React and TypeScript application built with Vite |
| `src/docs/` | Canonical in-app documentation, images and downloadable examples |
| `src/scripts/build-tasks.cjs` | Stage public assets/docs and publish Vite output |
| `src/package.json` | Build lifecycle shared by deployment and wheel preparation |
| `src/build.py` | Python entry point for that npm lifecycle |
| `src/deploy.py` | Build and stage a Databricks App deployment |
| `src/package_pip.py` | Prepare frontend assets and build the pip distribution |
| `pyproject.toml`, `hatch_build.py`, `packaging/kasal/` | Wheel packaging and CLI; dependencies come from the backend manifest |

Vite combines `frontend/public/` with `src/docs/` in the ignored
`frontend/.generated/public/` directory. It copies nested Markdown, images,
JSON examples and CSS, preserving `/docs/...` URLs. Edit `src/docs/`, then
restart Vite to refresh the staged documentation during development.

The root npm lifecycle publishes `frontend/dist/` as `src/frontend_static/`.
Deployment uploads that snapshot; the wheel includes it under
`kasal/_app/frontend_static`. Generated assets are not source files.

## Backend ownership

Paths in this section are relative to `src/backend/src/`.

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `main.py`, `api/__init__.py` | Application lifecycle, middleware and router composition |
| `api/` | HTTP routing, request validation and response translation |
| `dependencies/providers.py`, `dependencies/admin_auth.py` | Request/session injection and authentication checks; `core/dependencies.py` retains compatibility imports |
| `services/` | Domain operations and orchestration, grouped by domain |
| `repositories/` | Database and external storage access |
| `models/`, `schemas/` | SQLAlchemy entities and Pydantic contracts |
| `db/session.py`, `db/all_models.py` | Sessions and model registration |
| `db/self_heal/` | Deployed startup schema compatibility repairs |
| `db/lakebase_ddl.py` | Lakebase role/extension setup with savepoint isolation |
| `config/` | Runtime settings and logging configuration |
| `core/` | Shared infrastructure, LLM transport, events and runtime paths |
| `utils/` | Cross-domain helpers and documented lazy authentication lookups |
| `seeds/`, `seeds/skills_data/` | Shipped seed and skill content |

Endpoint request/response models belong to the corresponding `schemas/` domain.
Routers import them; the public field names and defaults stay with the schema.

Use the existing domain package for a service. Tool adapters under
`services/tools/` are intentionally flat; substantial reusable logic belongs
with its domain rather than being copied into each adapter.

Selected execution and integration entry points:

- `services/execution/service.py`: execution lifecycle facade.
- `services/execution/engine_service.py`: `KasalEngineService`, the hub that resolves the Chat, Agent Builder or Flow Builder path and delegates.
- `services/execution/finalization.py`: terminal outcomes and persistence retries.
- `services/execution/serialization.py`, `flow_name_inputs.py`: payload serialization and flow naming inputs behind the execution facade.
- `services/execution/logs/file_ingestion.py`: shared crew/flow file-log persistence; each executor retains its own failure policy.
- `services/groups/forwarded_identity.py`: fallback identity provisioning through the user repository, with transaction scope owned by the service.
- `services/execution/runtime/`: Kasal agent runtime (agent, task, crew and the tool-call loop).
- `services/execution/harnesses/`: runtime bindings (`binding.py`, `selection.py`), with `kasal/` and `crewai/` implementations.
- `services/execution/kernel/`: shared agent/task construction and tooling, used by both subprocess paths.
- `services/execution/checkpointing/`: crash-resume shared by the crew and flow paths.
- `services/execution/process_tree.py`: terminates only the process trees this server spawned.
- `services/execution/blocking_pools.py`: bounded thread pools for the subprocess paths' blocking waits and event relay.
- `core/llm/transport/`: the OpenAI-compatible LLM transport and tool-round loop; `core/events/`: the run event bus.
- `services/chat/`: the in-process Chat path.
- `services/agent_builder/`: crew preparation, execution and subprocess entry point.
- `services/flow_builder/`: flow assembly, execution, checkpoints and subprocess entry point.
- `services/execution/history.py`, `services/execution/logs/`: history and execution logs.
- `services/trace/`: trace ingestion, persistence and broadcasting.
- `services/llm/manager.py`: provider/model selection and streaming.
- `core/llm/robust_json.py`: tolerant JSON recovery for generated responses.
- `services/catalog/templates.py`: database-backed prompt-template lookup.
- `services/powerbi/pipeline_config.py`: shared Power BI extraction and configuration derivation.
  `services/tools/generate_config.py` retains the standalone CLI and compatibility imports.
- `services/scheduling/scheduler.py`: scheduled execution.
- `services/knowledge/documentation_embedding.py`: documentation embeddings.
- `services/databricks/`, `services/mlflow/`: integration services.

## Boundaries and transactions

Follow routers → services → repositories → models. Keep request assembly at
the API boundary, orchestration in services and I/O in repositories. Services
raise the application errors in `core/exceptions.py`; the global handler in
`main.py` translates their status, detail and headers into HTTP responses.
Catch `KasalError` before broad exception recovery when access failures must
propagate, especially during checkpoint resume. Exported app templates have
their own HTTP boundary and do not depend on the main application's services.

Services own transaction scope and use the injected session inside a request.
Background work uses `routed_scoped_session()`. Repositories neither acquire
sessions nor commit them. Operations spanning multiple writes, such as memory
configuration replacement, must retain one transaction.

`src/backend/pyproject.toml` contains the import-linter contracts and documented
lazy authentication exceptions. Preserve the service-level tenant checks in
those paths. A folder move must not bypass authorization.

Terminal execution state belongs to the existing finalization module. Keep
its failure/cancel/reject outcomes and retry behavior when splitting executors;
do not introduce another pending-outcome registry.

## Schema changes and shipped resources

Alembic configuration and revision history live in `src/backend/alembic.ini`
and `src/backend/migrations/`. They serve offline migration workflows.
Databricks deployment excludes that directory; startup repairs under
`db/self_heal/` have a separate role. Preserve applied revision identifiers.

Runtime/tool changes can affect export allowlists and generated imports under
`services/export/`. Update those consumers alongside source moves. The A2UI
frontend copy in the exported app template is intentional: deployed apps do
not contain the main frontend source. Its synchronization tests protect that
copy.

Keep backend package roots stable. The wheel embeds the application under
`kasal/_app/src`, and its CLI sets up the import path before loading `src.main`.

## Frontend ownership

Paths in this section are relative to `src/frontend/src/`.

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/App.tsx` | Routes, lazy screen imports, providers and application startup |
| `app/workspace/` | Cross-feature workspace layout, tabs, panels and dialogs |
| `app/connections/`, `app/approvals/`, `app/notifications/` | Application-wide streaming, approval listening and error notification policy |
| `features/chat/` | Chat workspace, state, hooks and views |
| `features/chat/persistence/` | Server session storage, queued writes, message mapping and legacy IndexedDB migration |
| `features/chat/api/`, `features/chat/types/` | Shared chat HTTP client and chat/dispatcher contracts |
| `features/executions/trace/lib/` | UI-independent trace processing, indexing and batching |
| `features/executions/trace/hooks/` | Trace fetching and React view state |
| `features/executions/trace/components/` | Trace event icons |
| `features/workflow/canvas/lib/` | Canvas layout calculations and graph indexing |
| `features/workflow/canvas/components/` | Crew/flow canvases, node/edge registry and controls |
| `features/workflow/{agents,tasks,crews,flows,scheduling,export}/` | Workflow editing, selection and export views |
| `features/workflow/assistant/` | Workflow conversation views, contracts, hooks and message state |
| `features/executions/`, `features/approvals/`, `features/triggers/` | Run history/results, approvals and event triggers |
| `features/configuration/`, `features/tools/`, `features/memory/`, `features/groups/` | Domain settings, tool configuration selectors, memory and workspace selection |
| `features/conversion/`, `features/help/` | Conversion tools, documentation, tutorials and best practices |
| `shared/api/` | Single Axios transport, workspace-header recovery and error publication |
| `shared/ui/` | Domain-independent presentation shared across features |
| `shared/lib/collections.ts` | Generic first-occurrence indexing and deduplication |
| `types/ui/layout.ts` | Application-wide workspace panel/layout state contract |
| `api/` | API clients grouped by domain |
| `types/` | Component-independent contracts grouped by domain |
| `store/`, `hooks/` | Existing shared state and hooks |
| `shared/` | Shared libraries and A2UI rendering |
| `utils/`, `theme/` | Existing utilities and app theme |

Preview parsing belongs to `features/chat/utils/preview.ts`, with its
contracts in `features/chat/types/preview.ts`. Skill selection lookup is
independent of state; reconciliation actions live under the chat store folder.
API clients, contracts and pure processing libraries must not import UI views.
The flat ESLint configuration enforces the boundaries already established.

`shared/api/client.ts` reads `VITE_API_URL`, defaulting to
`http://localhost:8000/api/v1` in development and `/api/v1` in production.
`config/api/ApiConfig.ts` is a compatibility re-export. App startup registers the
deduplicated database-outage toast; the transport does not import UI libraries.

Crew representations are separate: `types/workflow/crew.ts` holds API contracts,
`crewPayload.ts` serialized inputs and
`canvas.ts` canvas data. UI props live with the canvas and crew features.

Chat view models retain `Date` values and camelCase fields; persistence wire
contracts keep backend timestamp strings and snake_case fields. `messageCodec.ts`
owns their conversion. `legacySessionDb.ts` exists only for migration; server
sessions, previews and running-job markers remain in `sessionApi.ts`.

State storage keys, event names, endpoint URLs and CSS scopes are stable
contracts even when their source files move.

## Tests and checks

Frontend unit/component tests live beside their source. Run Vitest from
`src/frontend/`; `vitest.config.ts` owns coverage thresholds, including exact
paths that must move with covered files. `eslint.config.js` is the ESLint
configuration. `npm run build` checks TypeScript and produces the Vite bundle.

Backend tests live under `src/backend/tests/`, with unit suites following
source ownership. `src/backend/pyproject.toml` owns pytest discovery, asyncio
mode and markers. Run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` from `src/backend/`, adding
the relevant paths and explicit coverage options when needed. There is no
second configuration under `tests/`. Fixtures and artifact isolation live in
`tests/conftest.py`; architecture tests guard layering and test placement.

When moving code, update imports, mocks, coverage paths, export mappings and
resource locators together. Preserve lazy entry points and subprocess imports.
Test the affected behavior, and check built artifacts when their inputs move.
