## Install from the Databricks Marketplace

The recommended path is to install Kasal directly from the Databricks Apps Marketplace with one click. This is best for production use: Kasal deploys as a native Databricks App, inherits your workspace identity automatically (OAuth and on-behalf-of execution), and there is no separate infrastructure to run or connection to configure.

After installing, launch Kasal from your Databricks Apps. Because it runs inside your workspace, agents can query Unity Catalog, run SQL through your warehouses, and call your Foundation Model API or Model Serving endpoints with the calling user's permissions.

If you prefer a custom installation from source, you can deploy to your workspace with the included tooling:

```bash
python src/build.py
python src/deploy.py
```

`build.py` produces the frontend static assets, and `deploy.py` ships the app to your Databricks workspace. For managed Lakebase PostgreSQL so that crews, agents, tasks, and run history survive app restarts, see [./lakebase-deployment.md](./lakebase-deployment.md).

## Run locally

For testing and development you can run Kasal on your own machine. You need Python 3.11 (the backend pins `>=3.11,<3.12`) and Node.js 22. The backend uses `uv` for dependencies and auto-reloads on changes; the frontend uses hot module replacement.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/databrickslabs/kasal

# Start the backend (uv syncs dependencies automatically)
cd kasal/src/backend && ./run.sh

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd kasal/src/frontend && npm install && npm start
```

The app is served at `http://localhost:3000`. For deeper setup and configuration, see the [developer guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

## Build your first workflow

Open the Workflow Designer (left sidebar: Workflows, then Designer, or the direct route `/workflow`). You can build a workflow in a few steps:

1. Start from a template or a blank canvas. Drag agents onto the canvas and give each one a role, a goal, and the tools it should use.
2. Add tasks and describe what each agent should do in plain language, for example "research 5 trending topics and summarize each in 2 to 3 sentences". You can use placeholders like `{industry}` to parameterize inputs at run time.
3. Point the agents at your data: Unity Catalog tables, SQL warehouses, Volumes for documents, and vector indexes for semantic search.
4. Connect the nodes to define the collaboration flow, then run the workflow and watch agents work in real time, with live logs and execution traces.
