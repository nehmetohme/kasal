# MLflow tracing in Kasal: setup and requirements

Kasal can export every crew and flow execution to **MLflow Tracing** so you get a
full, expandable span tree (`agent` to `task` to `tool / llm`) for each run, viewable in
the Databricks MLflow UI. This page explains what tracing requires, how it differs
between production and local development, and how to verify it is working.

> **Where traces live:** MLflow traces are stored in an **MLflow Experiment**, a
> workspace object (a path like `/Shared/kasal-crew-execution-traces`). They are
> **not** stored in a Unity Catalog table or schema. If you created a UC schema for
> Kasal, leave it; it has nothing to do with tracing.

## The two gates

Tracing only runs when **both** of the following are satisfied:

| # | Gate | What it is | Where it is set |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Config toggle** | `mlflow_enabled` + the experiment name | Kasal's DB, set once per teamspace by an admin in the **Configuration** UI. Persists; not per-user. Defaults to **OFF**. |
| 2 | **Service Principal (SPN) credentials** | `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Must be present in the **backend process environment**. |

If the toggle is off, the execution subprocess skips MLflow before it ever touches
credentials. If the toggle is on but any SPN variable is missing, tracing is
skipped with the log line `SPN credentials required for MLflow ... skipping`.

> **Note:** the tracing path uses **OAuth Service Principal** credentials only. A
> personal access token (PAT / `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`) is **not** used for tracing by
> design.

## Where the SPN credentials come from (differs by environment)

This is the key nuance: **gate #2 is owned by the deployment platform, not the user.**

| Environment | Config toggle (#1) | SPN env vars (#2) |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Databricks Apps (production)** | Admin flips it once in the UI | **Automatic** (injected by the platform) |
| **Local development** | Flip in the UI (or seed in the DB) | **Manual** (you export them, dev only) |

### Production with Databricks Apps: fully automatic

When Kasal is deployed as a Databricks App, the app **runs as its own service
principal**, and the Apps platform **injects** `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`,
`DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `DATABRICKS_HOST` into the container's environment
at runtime: **zero manual steps, no shell script, nothing in `app.yaml`.**

So in production an end user does **nothing** for gate #2. An admin simply enables
the toggle (gate #1), and because the app's SP is already present in the
environment, tracing works.

**The one thing to ensure:** the app's service principal must have permission to
**write experiments** under the target path (e.g. `/Shared/`). That is a workspace
permission, not an environment variable.

> **Multi-app caveat:** every deployed Kasal app instance runs as a *different* app
> SP. If you standardize on one shared experiment path, each app's SP must be
> granted write access to it individually. Otherwise you will see
> `host=yes, spn_id=yes` followed by a permission error on `set_experiment`.

### Local development: manual

There is no Apps platform locally to inject anything, so you supply the SP
credentials yourself. This is purely a **dev convenience** that mimics what the
platform does automatically in production. It is *not* how production works and is
never shipped to customers.

1. **Obtain a service principal with an OAuth secret** in the target workspace. If
   you are a workspace admin you can create one; otherwise reuse an SP you own and
   generate a secret for it:

   ```bash
   # Create an OAuth secret for an existing service principal (workspace-level)
   databricks service-principal-secrets-proxy create <SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID>
   ```

   You need the SP's **application ID** (the client ID) and the generated **secret**.

2. **Export the three variables** in the shell that launches the backend, then start it:

   ```bash
   export DATABRICKS_HOST="https://<your-workspace>.cloud.databricks.com"
   export DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID="<service-principal-application-id>"
   export DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET="<service-principal-oauth-secret>"
   cd src/backend && ./run.sh
   ```

   (You can keep these in a local, git-ignored file and `source` it; just make sure
   they end up in the backend process environment.)

3. **Enable the toggle** in the Kasal Configuration UI and set the experiment name
   (default `kasal-crew-execution-traces`, which resolves to
   `/Shared/kasal-crew-execution-traces`).

4. **Run a crew**. On the first kickoff the experiment is created and traces appear.

### Non-Apps production (edge case)

If Kasal runs outside Databricks Apps (a plain VM/container), inject the SPN
credentials via that platform's secret/env mechanism (container env, Kubernetes
secret, systemd unit, etc.). This is still environment/secret config, never a checked-in
shell script. The standard Kasal deployment target is Databricks Apps, so this
rarely applies.

## Finding your traces

In the Databricks UI, go to **Machine Learning**, **Experiments**, then open the
experiment matching your configured name, e.g. `/Shared/kasal-crew-execution-traces`.
Each run is a trace you can expand into its `agent` to `task` to `tool / llm` span tree.

The numeric `?o=...` in a workspace URL is just the workspace org id. It is not the
experiment id, so a bare `/ml/experiments?o=...` URL only shows the experiment list.

## Verifying it works (backend log)

Watch the crew/subprocess log when you run a workflow. A healthy run shows, in order:

```text
[SUBPROCESS] MLflow enabled_for_workspace=True
[SUBPROCESS] MLflow auth env: host=yes, spn_id=yes, spn_cred=yes
[SUBPROCESS] MLflow experiment set: /Shared/kasal-crew-execution-traces (ID: <id>)
[SUBPROCESS] MLflow tracing destination set to experiment <id>
[OTel-MLflow][<job>] Flushed async trace logging (trace_id=tr-...)
[OTel-MLflow][<job>] VERIFY trace_id=tr-...: get_trace OK, retrievable spans=<N>
```

`retrievable spans=<N>` with `N > 0` is the definitive proof: it reads the trace
back from Databricks immediately after upload and confirms the span data persisted.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom in log | Cause | Fix |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| `MLflow enabled_for_workspace=False` / `MLflow is disabled ... skipping` | Gate #1: toggle is off | Enable MLflow in the Configuration UI |
| `host=yes, spn_id=no, spn_cred=no` then `SPN credentials required ... skipping` | Gate #2: SPN env vars not in the process | Export them (local) / confirm the app SP is injected (prod) |
| Permission error on `set_experiment` | The SP cannot write to the experiment path | Grant the SP write access to the target experiment (e.g. under `/Shared/`) |
| Trace appears but has **no child spans** (only a summary) | Span-data (`traces.json`) upload did not complete before the subprocess exited | Ensure the build includes the async-flush fix; `VERIFY ... retrievable spans=N` confirms persistence |
