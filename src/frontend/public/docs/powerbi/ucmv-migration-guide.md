## Before you begin

- [ ] Non-Admin SP configured ([authentication setup](./01-authentication-setup.md))
- [ ] Admin SP configured ([authentication setup](./01-authentication-setup.md))
- [ ] Kasal running (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Target Databricks workspace with UC enabled
- [ ] Power BI Workspace ID and Dataset ID for the model to migrate

## What you'll have at the end

For each Power BI fact table, a Unity Catalog Metric View that can be queried with standard SQL:

```sql
-- Before (Power BI, DAX):
[Total Revenue] := SUM(Fact_Sales[Amount])
[YoY Growth] := CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))

-- After (Databricks, UC Metric View):
SELECT
  MEASURE(Total_Revenue),
  MEASURE(YoY_Growth)
FROM my_catalog.metrics.fact_sales_uc_metric_view
GROUP BY Region, Quarter
```

Any BI tool (including Power BI) can query UC Metric Views. The business logic now lives in Databricks, governed by Unity Catalog.

## Overview: the 5-phase pipeline

```text
Phase 1: EXTRACT (automatic, ~5 minutes)
Tool 74: M-Query to source SQL per table
Tool 73: Measures to DAX expressions
Tool 75: Relationships to FK structure (optional, recommended)
    |
Phase 2: PROPOSE CONFIG (automatic, ~2 minutes)
Tool 90: Call 4 PBI APIs to produce proposed pipeline_config.json (26 keys)
    |
Phase 3: HUMAN REVIEW (manual, 2-3 hours first time, 30 min for similar models)
SA fills TODO markers in config:
  - switch_decompositions (biggest effort)
  - filter_sets, measure_resolutions, mapping_only_tables
    |
Phase 4: GENERATE (automatic, ~30 seconds)
Tool 87: Allocate measures to fact tables (if needed)
Tool 86: Full pipeline to YAML + SQL per fact table + migration report
    |
Phase 5: VALIDATE + DEPLOY
Tool 88: Dry-run validation, human approval, live deployment
```

Failures in Phase 5 loop back to Phase 3 (adjust config, re-run Phase 4).

## Phase 1: extract

Run these three tasks in Kasal. They can run in parallel or sequentially.

### Task A - extract M-Query (Tool 74)

Requires Admin SP.

```text
workspace_id: your-workspace-guid
dataset_id: your-dataset-guid
tenant_id: your-tenant-guid
client_id: ADMIN_SP_client_id
client_secret: ADMIN_SP_client_secret
```

### Task B - extract measures (Tool 73)

Requires Non-Admin SP.

```text
workspace_id: your-workspace-guid
dataset_id: your-dataset-guid
tenant_id: your-tenant-guid
client_id: NON_ADMIN_SP_client_id
client_secret: NON_ADMIN_SP_client_secret
outbound_format: uc_metrics
```

### Task C - extract relationships (Tool 75)

Requires Non-Admin SP.

```text
workspace_id: your-workspace-guid
dataset_id: your-dataset-guid
tenant_id: your-tenant-guid
client_id: NON_ADMIN_SP_client_id
client_secret: NON_ADMIN_SP_client_secret
```

**Save the JSON outputs** from each task - you'll need them for Phase 4.

## Phase 2: propose config

Run Tool 90. This calls all 4 PBI APIs and produces the initial `pipeline_config.json`.

```text
workspace_id: your-workspace-guid
dataset_id: your-dataset-guid
tenant_id: your-tenant-guid
client_id: NON_ADMIN_SP_client_id
client_secret: NON_ADMIN_SP_client_secret
admin_client_id: ADMIN_SP_client_id
admin_client_secret: ADMIN_SP_client_secret
report_id: your-report-guid  (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED — see note below)
catalog: my_catalog
schema_name: metrics
```

> **⚠️ `report_id` strongly affects measure quality — do not skip it.**
> Despite the "Optional: Report Metadata" label in the UI, the report is where the
> full measure DAX lives (the report's visual bindings carry the real measure
> expressions). **Without a `report_id`, config-gen falls back to a degraded source
> that returns bare column names instead of measure bodies — roughly halving the
> number of translatable measures.** As of the PROP-7 change the tool
> auto-discovers the report bound to your `dataset_id` when this field is left
> empty, and warns loudly in the result if none is found. Provide it explicitly
> when you can; if you don't know it, list the workspace's reports and pick the one
> whose `datasetId` matches your semantic model.

Download the proposed config from the result. It will have `TODO` markers where human input is needed.

## Phase 3: human review

This is the most important phase. Open the proposed config and work through the TODOs:

### Priority order (biggest translation rate unlock first)

**1. `switch_decompositions`** - largest impact
SWITCH statements in DAX often represent dimension-based branching (e.g. "if this is an HR measure, use this SQL; if Finance, use that SQL"). The SA provides the SQL for each branch.

```json
"switch_decompositions": {
  "Fact_HR_A": {
    "HC_Headcount": {
      "num": "SUM(source.headcount)",
      "den": null,
      "filters": ["source.employee_type = 'FTE'"]
    }
  }
}
```

**2. `measure_resolutions`** - cross-table measure references
When a measure in one fact table references a measure defined in another table, the SA provides the base SQL expression.

```json
"measure_resolutions": {
  "[Fact_B Revenue]": {
    "base_expr": "SUM(source_b.revenue)",
    "base_filters": []
  }
}
```

**3. `filter_sets`** - reusable CALCULATE filter groups
Named filter sets that multiple CALCULATE measures reference.

```json
"filter_sets": {
  "CORE_FILTER": ["source.status IN ('Active', 'Pending')"],
  "YTDA_FILTER": ["source.fiscal_year = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)"]
}
```

**4. `mapping_only_tables`** - pure-mapping fact tables
Tables that just map keys to dimensions (no aggregatable measures).

```json
"mapping_only_tables": {
  "Fact_HR_B": {
    "source_table": "my_catalog.raw.fact_hr_b",
    "dimensions": ["employee_id", "cost_center"],
    "aggregate_columns": []
  }
}
```

### What to skip

- `join_key_map` - auto-filled by Tool 90, review only
- `column_metadata` - auto-filled, usually no changes needed
- `dimension_exclusions` - auto-filled, verify the table name is correct

### Estimating effort

| Model complexity | First migration | Repeat (similar model) |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Simple (<50 measures, few SWITCH) | 30-60 minutes | 15-30 minutes |
| Medium (100-300 measures) | 2-3 hours | 45-90 minutes |
| Complex (300+ measures, many SWITCH) | 4-6 hours | 2-3 hours |

## Phase 4: generate

Run Tool 86 with the completed config. If measures don't have `proposed_allocation` yet, run Tool 87 first.

Tool 87 (if needed):

```text
measures_json: [from Tool 73 output]
mquery_json: [from Tool 74 output]
```

Tool 86:

```text
measures_json: [from Tool 87 output or Tool 73 directly]
mquery_json: [from Tool 74 output]
relationships_json: [from Tool 75 output]
config_json: [your completed pipeline_config.json]
catalog: my_catalog
schema_name: metrics
```

### Reviewing the migration report

Tool 86 produces a migration report. Key things to check:

```text
Fact Table: fact_sales
  Total measures: 45
  Translated: 40 (88.9%)
  Untranslatable: 5
    - [Color_Flag]: FORMAT pattern - PBI display artifact, skip
    - [Dynamic_Switch]: SELECTEDVALUE+SWITCH - add to switch_decompositions
    - [Cross_Table_Ref]: References [Fact_HR_A Revenue] - add to measure_resolutions
```

**If translation rate is below your target:** go back to Phase 3, fix the flagged items, re-run Tool 86. Each iteration takes ~30 seconds.

### Typical iteration count

- First run: ~60-70% translation rate (config needs more detail)
- After switch_decompositions: ~75-80%
- After measure_resolutions: ~85-90%
- With LLM fallback enabled: ~90-95%

## Phase 5: validate and deploy

### Step 1: dry run (Tool 88)

```text
yaml_specs_json: [from Tool 86 output]
sql_specs_json: [from Tool 86 output]
catalog: my_catalog
schema_name: metrics
dry_run: true
```

Review the validation report. All metric views should show `status: validated`.

### Step 2: customer review

Share the YAML and migration report with the customer. Get approval on:

- Measure names and SQL expressions
- Join structures
- Translation rate and list of skipped measures

### Step 3: live deploy (Tool 88)

After customer approval:

```text
dry_run: false
databricks_host: https://<your-workspace>.cloud.databricks.com
databricks_token: your-databricks-pat
warehouse_id: your-warehouse-id
```

### Step 4: smoke test

After deployment, verify with:

```sql
SHOW METRIC VIEWS IN my_catalog.metrics;

SELECT MEASURE(Total_Revenue), MEASURE(YoY_Growth)
FROM my_catalog.metrics.fact_sales_uc_metric_view
GROUP BY Region
LIMIT 10;
```

## Running the demo (no PBI credentials needed)

The fastest way to demo the pipeline is the **BI Specialist teamspace** built into Kasal.
On startup, Kasal seeds 9 pre-configured crew templates covering the full pipeline:

1. Open Kasal, then **Teamspaces**, then switch to **BI Specialist**
2. Go to **Crews**. The UCMV Generation Pipeline crew is already there
3. Build a flow by connecting crews on the **Flows** canvas
4. Run it against your own data or use the pre-configured demo inputs

No Python setup, no backend access required.

## Iteration tips

- **Re-run Tool 86 as many times as needed**: it's deterministic and fast (~30 seconds)
- **LLM fallback** (`use_llm_fallback: true`) can handle complex SWITCH and cross-table patterns that regex rules miss. Use it after exhausting config-based improvements
- **Each fact table is independent**: if one fails validation, the others still deploy; fix and re-run that table alone
- **Tool 89** (gap analysis) shows which config keys would unlock the most additional measure translations

## Example crews (JSON)

Ready-to-import crew definitions are in [`src/docs/examples/`](../examples/):

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `crew_ucmv_pipeline_config_generator.json` | Config generation crew (Tool 90) |
| `crew_uc_metric_view_generator.json` | UC Metric View generation crew (Tool 86) |
| `crew_ucmv_quality_validator.json` | Validation crew (Tool 91) |
